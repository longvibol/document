- npx create-react-app todo-app : creact project name "todo-app"
- npm start : start the app in development mode 
- npm init : install package in our app 
- npm test : test mode 
- npm run build : to build a production deployable unite 
* npm install : install dependency to package js

================= short cut in VS code 
1. Ctrl + B = Explore 
2. Ctrl + P = Search box

=================== JS Over View 

1. index.html : in side <body> have <div id = "root"></div> it is react running 
2. index.js : runing in the folder src/index.js (have function App() it called Component 
in the js file many component are running. 
3. App.js the last file that contain : className="App" 


========== Why do we need React Components?
Web applications have complex structure so to separate components for each page element
==> Modularization and can Reuse code 

*** Component in React have many kind 
We create compoent by put the App component is the header for the child component :
Component can be as below: 
- View (JSX or JavaScript) ដើម្បីបង្ហាញ
- Logic (JavaScript) file is .js
- Styling (CSS)
- State (Internal Data Store for the components) រក្សាទុកទិន្នន័យ component ក្នុងម៉ាស៊ីន
- Props (Pass Data betweek component and component) ផ្លាស់ប្តូរទិន្នន័យ component and component 

Name of the component must be : Capital letter ex: function FirstComponent(){}

- Function Component : becaue we use function to create component that why it call function component!
Ex: function FirstComponent(){
  return (
    <div className='FirstComponent'>First Component</div>
  )
}

===> call : <FirstComponent></FirstComponent>

- Class Component: 
Ex: class ThirdComponent extends Component{
  render(){
    return(
      <div className='ThirdComponent'>Third Component</div>
    )
  }
}

===> call : <ThirdComponent/>

* each java file presentation .js is call modul 
Noted: in prevouse version of React below 16.8 only Class Component can crate State.
Start is the Buil-in React object used to contain data or information about the component. 

That why they crate "Hooks" after React 16.8 Version
- it is very easy to use for hooks 
- useState hook allows adding state to Function Component 

from now on the will use Function Component in React!!!

================ why we use ()

- React project use JSX for presentation ( Java Scrip xml) 
- JSX file is Stricter than HTML
EX: <div className='FirstComponent'>First Component</div>
is the JSX syntax 
+ JSX can return only one file <div><div/> or <></> (empty wrapper)
+ Old brower can not read js file that why they create Babel to compatibility
- ES2015,ES2022....

* មានន័យថា Babel វាជាអ្នកបកប្រែទៅ JSX កូដ JS cod សម្រាប់ Broswer ចាស់ៗ

Note: JSX (React use JSX code)
- Parenthese () need; JSC need upper case letter in the Component (function FirstComponent) 
- HTML tag is small case
- callName use for JSX



================= import component 
****
- import {FithComponent} from "./components ពេលដាក់ {} គឺយើងចង់អ្វីដែលមិនមែនជា defaul component 

We have two kind of import ; defalu import and Name import component 

=============== create object in JS

Ex:
